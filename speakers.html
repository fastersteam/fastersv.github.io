        <p>
          I'm the opposite of most kids -- I was born in the US, but moved to the Philippines as a kid... I was pretty confused nine year old, after nine years of brainwashing I had to learn that no one in Manila recycled or called grown-ups by their first names! After eight years in Manila, I moved back to the Bay Area for college. I studied Cognitive Science at Berkeley and served as the Executive Director of P4 (I thought I wanted to be a lawyer) and the co-Editor in Chief of Maganda Magazine. After graduating I was a Solutions Engineer at IntApp for three years, a Technical Account Manager at Google for 2.5, and am currently the Senior Manager for Solutions Engineering at a startup, Sift Science. I have a technical background but also love working with customers and understanding their issues and have built a career around being the glue that holds engineering and customers together. In my role at Sift I've built and manage a team of Solutions Engineers, Support and Sales Development. I'm a jack-of-all trades when it comes to customer needs and have done everything from answer support tickets to building them new features to negotiating contracts.
