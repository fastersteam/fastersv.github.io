					<p>BERKELEY, CA -- Filipino Americans in Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics (FASTER) is
honored to have the Silicon Valley legend, Dado Banatao this year’s keynote speaker at the annual
FASTERCON conference hosted in UC Berkeley on Saturday, October 6. Every Filipino American History
Month, FASTER, a community organization dedicated to cultivating the Filipino American community in tech
celebrates the contributions of leading Filipino American technology professionals making an impact on
the tech industry and community and in partnership with media outlets, The Filipino Channel University
(TFCU) and Kubo. The hope is to increase more Filipino American youth from all backgrounds to pursue
careers in tech, and especially in engineering, where the number of Filipino Americans nationally in the
profession still remain underrepresented. FASTER pays homage to trailblazers like Banatao and highlight
both seasoned professionals and millennials succeeding across various verticals and roles in the tech
industry including blockchain, augmented and virtual reality, cleantech, biotech, artificial intelligence.<br>
The conference, along with the annual mentorship program, helps build upon the effort for facilitating a
strategic pipeline into the tech industry. Students and professionals listen in on a fireside chat with
Banatao, considered to be the leading Filipino American Silicon Valley tech pioneer, whom also has a hall
in his name in the engineering school at Cal. He is well known for making his mark in computer hardware
early on and was a part of the wave of innovation with key tech thought leaders such as Steve Jobs and
Steve Wozniak (Apple’s co-founders from Berkeley). Banatao has given back generously over the years
through many initiatives, including PhilDev Foundation and an Asian Pacific Fund scholarship in his name
awarded to excelling high school students pursuing careers in engineering. Banatao scholar, UC Berkeley
alumnus, and FASTER Board member spearheading the young alumni and student organizing conference
committee, Corrina Calanoc, noted the significance of continuing mentorship for FASTER which features
their annual mentorship program for students interested in pursuing tech careers. <br>
“I benefited greatly from having people throughout my college experience serve as ate's and kuya's who
helped me navigate institutions as a first generation college student. I've already seen the brilliance and
innovation that transpires from accomplished engineers working together with students to tackle world
problems during my time as a Banatao scholar. At first glance it seems like there's still such sparse
representation in tech, but formalizing mentorship within this industry will give folks a better picture of how
wide our community spreads and that's so exciting to me." <br>
This year’s conference agenda includes programs for Filipino American students and professionals.
Breakout sessions for Filipino tech professionals include workshops for Employee Resource Groups
(ERGs), independent consultants, tech startup entrepreneurs, and Pinays in tech (sponsored by Filipinas In
Computing under the Anita Borg Institute Systers affinity groups). Charity Nicolas, Cal Pilipino American
Alumni Chapter President and FASTER Board Member, recently founded Tech-In-Color, where members of FASTER PROS professional component, provide community service to high school students giving them
exposure toward various tech career paths. Tech-In-Color allows students to experience a “day-in-the-life”
shadowing through company tours with partner companies such as Gap, Pinterest, Pandora, Twilio, and
Tesla.<br>
“As a mother and first-generation Filipina, I hope Tech-In-Color and FASTER will create more equity for
students of color looking for opportunities leading into tech and STEAM careers. By building a pipeline
now, we hope this professional support system will provide invaluable guidance and mentorship to them
throughout their career journey,” Nicolas continued.<br>
Erin Pangilinan, FASTER Founder and Board President reiterated the importance of early exposure to
support the life cycle of Filipino Americans as a whole and recognizing and celebrating Filipino American
tech professionals at all roles and levels who have historically contributed to the making of Silicon Valley.<br>
“Silicon Valley's rich history of Asian American contributions is significant, and Filipino Americans have
always been a part of that storyline, whether it has been tech legends like Dado Banatao, our uncles and
aunties working on the assembly line at Selectron like mine, or my parents in biotech as research and
development scientists, our community’s stories need to be told. Early exposure to the tech industry in my
own backyard carried me through all different phases of my career from civic engagement and now back
into the spaces of immersive and emerging tech. Not everyone has that kind of support. We want to be
able to help our community look to leading professionals and encourage others to aspire for achievement
in their career, whether academic or industry related to technology, with an emphasis on technical skills
that enables many to rise up like Dado and become leaders not only for the Filipino American community,
but for all those entering tech. FASTER’s values strive for excellence in professionalism and education as
well as serving community and we believe Dado embodies that. We encourage all students to become like
him, and many other leading professionals no matter their background to demonstrate it is possible to
achieve greatness.” Pangilinan emphasized that these success stories and those also readily forgotten
have powered Silicon Valley’s tech companies for years.<br>
“Many people do not talk about folks like Dado, Bobby Murphy (co-founder and CTO of SnapChat, and
Stanford alumnus). We have talented folks in all areas of the industry from founders, lead designers,
engineers, managers etc. that are relatively unknown and we hope through learning by example and
sharing these stories, in our conference and through media partnerships, to spread the message
partnering with TFCU, Kubo etc. and hope to inspire the next generation of Filipino Americans to enter
careers in tech where they can bring value in impacting the lives of millions with the products that they
create and services they provide.”<br>
FASTER is dedicated to helping students and professionals rise in the next step of their career,
encouraging professionals to leverage their networks with cross collaboration. FASTER strengthens a
network of support through service. It takes a village to thrive as any entrepreneur and FASTER helps the
tech ecosystem that we hope will bring more Filipino Americans into the tech workforce and engender
Filipino American made-products and Filipino American founded companies now and for generations to
come.</p>
